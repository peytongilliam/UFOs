# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of creating this webpage and performing this analysis is to have the ability to search and filter through UFO sightings using a table. With this table, we are able to search the UFO sightings by city, state, country, shape, or date. This filtering capability makes it easier for us to search through the UFO sightings by specific criteria.

## Results
We are able to perform a search on this webpage by using the filter search boxes to the left of the table. We can search for a specific date, city, state, country, or shape by entering it into the corresponding search field. When we enter the specific criteria we want to search by, it will present the information we are wanting to gather. Below are two examples of search results.

## Summary
While this site is useful in searching specific criteria for UFO sightings, one downfall of the setup for filtering the table is you can only search for one of each specific ID at a time. For example, if you wanted to search for the date 1/1/2010 and 1/12/2010 you would have to do two individual searches as you are unable to filter both dates at the same time. The same would go for if you wanted to look up more than one of any of the criteria. You will have to search each individual date, city, state, country, or shape separately. 

To improve the filtering of the table, we could always do multiple search boxes for the same criteria that would allow to do a range or multiple of the same ID at a time. We could also do a dropdown box that would allow more than one search at a time for an individual ID. Another improvement that could be made would be to allow to sort by other criteria. It appears as though the only way the table can be sorted is by oldest to newest date. I believe it would be beneficial if there was a way to sort based on shape, or even newest date to oldest date.
